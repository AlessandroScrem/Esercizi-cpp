Both vector and list have a member function back() that returns a reference to the last element.
To use it, you have to be sure that there really is a last element for back() to refer to - don’t use it on an empty container.
That’s why we defined a Document to end with an empty 2 Line.
Note that we store every character from input, even the newline characters ('\n').
Storing those newline characters greatly simplifies output, but you have to be careful how you define a character count (just
countingcharacters will give a number that includes space and newline characters).
